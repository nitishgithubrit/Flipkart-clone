## What I Learned During Development

Creating this Flipkart clone helped me reinforce my understanding of:

* Structuring complex web layouts using HTML.
* Styling websites to match a specific design using CSS, including responsive design techniques.
* Adding basic interactivity and dynamic behavior using JavaScript on the client-side.
* Mimicking the user interface and user experience of a large-scale e-commerce platform.

## Potential Future Enhancements (Frontend or Full-Stack)

* More advanced JavaScript for richer interactions and animations.
* Integration with a backend API for real product data and search.
* Implementing a functional shopping cart using `localStorage` or a backend.
* User authentication (login/signup).
* More detailed filtering and sorting functionalities.
